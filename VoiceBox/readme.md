//EP350-FinalProjectAudioProcessor//

// This program utilizes cocoapods for some custom user interface objects and csound for the audio processing. VoiceBox is used by clicking through the menu in the lower half of the screen to pick a preset. The sliders correspond to different effects, some global and some local to the preset. Cyan preset is the classic helium voice, Magenta is dry input with ability to add processing, Yellow is low voice, and Black is a harmonized dry input with live control of the single harmony. Try plugging in a guitar for some weird effects too//
